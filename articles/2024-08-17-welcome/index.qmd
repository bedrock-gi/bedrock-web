## 📖 Read / write Ground Investigation (GI) data in different formats

| Data Format | Read | Write |
|-------------|------|-------|
| AGS 3       | ✅  | ❌    |
| AGS 4       | Soon | [python-ags4](https://pypi.org/project/python-AGS4/) |
| Excel       | ✅  | ✅    |
| CSV         | ✅  | ✅    |
| JSON        | ✅  | ✅    |
| GeoJSON     | ✅  | ✅    |

What do you need? [DIGGS](https://diggsml.org/)? [NADAG](https://www.ngu.no/geologisk-kartlegging/om-nadag-nasjonal-database-grunnundersokelser)? [GEF](https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/STREAM/Dutch+National+GEF+Standards)?  Something else?  
Let us know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/bedrock-gi/bedrock-gi/issues) or starting a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/bedrock-gi/discussions) 💭

Also, if you have a project with publicly available GI data, please share that in a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/bedrock-gi/discussions), such that we can create a tutorial from it 🤩

## ✅ Validate your GI data

`bedrock-gi` comes with data validation to make sure that you can combine Ground Investigation data from multiple files into a single GIS database with consistent relationships between GI locations, samples, in-situ measurements and lab tests.

This data validation mechanism (based on [`pandera`](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) is easily extensible, giving you the power to add your own data validation criteria 💪

## 🗺️ Put your GI data from multiple files into a single 3D GIS database

For example, you can take GI data from 100 AGS files and combine them into a single a [GeoPackage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoPackage) ([like a Shapefile, but then waaay better](http://switchfromshapefile.org/)). Such a GeoPackage can then be loaded into ArcGIS, such that you can visualize your GI data in 3D, and perform analyses:

## 🟦 Put your GI data into Speckle

Once you have your GI data inside [Speckle](https://speckle.systems/), it's super easy to visualize GI data together with civil engineering designs:

</p>

Moreover, your GI data becomes available in all the software that [Speckle has connectors for](https://app.speckle.systems/downloads).

## 🔓 Free and Open Source Software

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) gives you full access to the code, which means you can customize `bedrock-gi` to integrate with other tools and fit your workflows & project needs.

As the name implies, FOSS is free to use, so you're not tied to expensive software licenses or locked into a specific software vendor ⛓️‍💥

You can give [feedback](#-feedback) and [contribute](#-contributing), such that together we together can build the tools we've always wanted and needed 🤝
