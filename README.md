## Overview

> **Definition of Bedrock**
>
> In an abstract sense, the bedrock refers to the main principles something is based on. [1]
>
> In the real world, the bedrock is the hard area of rock in the ground that holds up the loose soil above. [1]
>
> In many civil engineering projects, the identification of the bedrock through digging, drilling or geophysical methods is an important task, which greatly influences (geotechnical) design. [2]

Ground Investigation (GI) data is often trapped in legacy formats that limit analysis and visualization possibilities.
`bedrock-ge` lets you transform this data from specialized geotechnical formats and common tabular formats (Excel, CSV) into modern, standardized geospatial data.

This standardization lets you bridge the gap between raw geotechnical data, the modern Python (geo)scientific ecosystem and modern geospatial tools.
This gives geotechnical engineers greater flexibility in visualization, modeling, and integration across different software environments while avoiding vendor lock-in.
For example, this enables connecting your GI data with GIS as well as BIM environments through [platforms like Speckle](#-put-your-gi-data-into-speckle).

The purpose of Bedrock is NOT to become THE standard for geotechnical data, because [we don't need 15 instead of 14 competing standards](https://xkcd.com/927/). 

## Highlights

### 📖 Read / write Ground Investigation (GI) data in different formats

| Data Format | Read | Write |
| ----------- | ---- | ----- |
| AGS 3       | ✅   | ❌    |
| AGS 4       | ✅   | ✅    |
| Excel       | ✅   | ✅    |
| CSV         | ✅   | ✅    |
| JSON        | ✅   | ✅    |
| GeoJSON     | ✅   | ✅    |

Do you need another format? Like [DIGGS](https://diggsml.org/), [NADAG](https://www.ngu.no/geologisk-kartlegging/om-nadag-nasjonal-database-grunnundersokelser), [GEF](https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/STREAM/Dutch+National+GEF+Standards), or something else?
Let us know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/bedrock-engineer/bedrock-ge/issues) or starting a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/bedrock-engineer/discussions).

Also, if you have a project with publicly available GI data, please share that in a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/bedrock-engineer/discussions), such that we can create a tutorial from it.

### ✅ Validate your GI data

`bedrock-ge` comes with data validation to make sure that you can combine Ground Investigation data from multiple files into a single geospatial database with consistent relationships between GI locations, samples, in-situ measurements and lab tests.

This data validation mechanism (based on [`pandera`](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) is easily extensible, giving you the power to add your own data validation criteria.

### 🗺️ Put your GI data from multiple files into a single 3D geospatial database

For example, you can take GI data from 100 AGS files and combine them into a single a [GeoPackage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoPackage) ([like a Shapefile, but then waaay better](http://switchfromshapefile.org/)). Such a GeoPackage can then be loaded into ArcGIS, where you can visualize your GI data in 3D:

### 🟦 Put your GI data into Speckle

From ArcGIS or QGIS you can publish your GI data to [Speckle](https://speckle.systems/) and then visualize it together with your ground models and civil engineering designs:

Moreover, your GI data becomes available in all the software that [Speckle has connectors for](https://app.speckle.systems/downloads).

### 🔓 Free and Open Source Software

`bedrock-ge` is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), meaning it gives you full access to the code, and you can customize `bedrock-ge` to integrate with other tools and fit your workflows and project needs.

As the name implies, FOSS is free to use, so you're not tied to expensive software licenses or locked into a specific software vendor.

You can give [feedback](#-feedback) and [contribute](#-contributing), such that together we can build the tools we've always wanted and needed.

## Installation of `bedrock-ge`

> [!CAUTION]
> This is the repo for Bedrock's website. The installation instructions below are for Bedrock's Python package `bedrock-ge`. The GitHub repo for `bedrock-ge` can be found here: [github.com/bedrock-engineer/bedrock-ge](https://github.com/bedrock-engineer/bedrock-ge).

We recommend to use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python for you.
Using `uv`, you can add `bedrock-ge` to your Python project and install it in your project's virtual environment by running:

```bash
uv add bedrock-ge

> Bedrock is the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) that I wish existed when I worked as a geotechnical engineer at Arup.

### Jules

> I studied Applied Geoscience (Petroleum Engineering Reservoir Geology) but frustration with technical software led me to learn to code and as a result, I mostly worked in software development.
>
> Over the past 5 years, I’ve worked on data-rich applications across various domains, specifically in frontend development.
> My primary interest is figuring out how to build tools for more thoughtful processing and display of technical information, for geoscience in particular.
